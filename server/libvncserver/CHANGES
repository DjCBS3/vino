 + Broken out rfbProcessNewConnection() from rfbCheckFds()
   (basically the chunk of code that begins with accept()
   and ends with rfbNewClient) and rfbUpdateClient from
   rfbProcessEvents (the code between FB_UPDATE_PENDING
   and rfbSendFrameBufferUpdate). This is for mainloop
   integration.

 + Added support for version 3.7 of the RFB protocol. The
   only difference between 3.7 and 3.3 is security type
   negotiation.

 + Removed the default password checking implementations
   along with the password storage imeplementation.
   Add a securityTypes array (and functions to initialize it)
   instead of doing the challenge-response if rfbAuthPasswdData
   is non-NULL.

 + Added the rfbTlsWithNoAuth and rfbTlsWithVncAuth security
   types which cause a TLS handshake to be negotiated
   immediately after the security type is agreed upon. TLS
   support is added using libgnutls.

 + Changed vncRandomBytes to use libgcrypt's
   cryptographically strong random number generator to
   ensure the challenge is wholly unpredictable reducing the
   risk of a replay attack.

 + Added a authenticatedClientHook hook so that the user can
   be prompted on whether to allow authenticated clients to
   connect. A second level of authentication.

 + Removed defaultNewClientHook and made accept new clients
   by default.

 + Made TRUE == 1 to agree with glib's idea of the truth.

 + Completely re-worked cursor handling such that the fact
   that the cursor is sometimes drawn on the frame buffer
   is not exposed in the API. The cursor is undrawn
   immediately after sending the update to the client.

 + Warning fixes:
     o killed rfbPrintXCursor() - not used
     o put rfbIncrClientRef(), rfbIncrClientRef() and
       rfbClientIteratorHead() into rfb/rfb.h. They weren't
       put there originally because they're "private", but
       there's loads of private stuff there already. Fixes
       "no previous prototype" warnings.
     o Renamed TightCleanup to rfbTightCleanup and put it
       into rfb/rfb.h for the same reason.
     o made rfbDefaultLog() static.
     o Made a load of sraSpan functions static.
     o Killed sraSpanCheck() - unused.
     o Removed unused addr, addrlen and buf variables from
       rfbCheckFds().
     o Made rfbSendOneRectEncodingZlib() static.
     o Made ZRLE_ENCODE_TILE and ZRLE_ENCODE template functions
       static.
     o Added "void" to the sraRgnCreate so it gets recognised
       as a valid prototype.

 + Added rfbSetCursorPosition and used it in defaultPtrAddEvent.

 + Made rfbMakeXCursor take const char *.

 + Removed all the UDP code. The comment said:

"
UDP can be used for keyboard and pointer events when the underlying
network is highly reliable.  This is really here to support ORL's
videotile, whose TCP implementation doesn't like sending lots of small
packets (such as 100s of pen readings per second!).
"

   we obviously don't need it.

 + Removed reverseConnection and CORBA support.

 + Removed the back channel support.

 + Removed dontSendFramebufferUpdate and comment - must be remnants
   of Xvnc.

 + Disable support for shape updates when there is no support
   for position updates. Position updates were already disabled
   if shape updates aren't supported.

 + Don't call clientGoneHook if its NULL and don't initialize
   clientGoneHook to a doNothing function.

 + Removed all references to the kbdReleaseAllKeys hook. Its
   not used.

 + Removed doNothingWithClient.

 + Removed the setTranslateFunction hook and always call
   rfbSetTranslateFunction().

 + Removed the getCursorPtr hook and always just use
   screen->cursor.

 + Removed displayHook.

 + Removed defaultKbdAddEvent and handled NULL for
   kbdAddEvent. Same for setXCutText.

 + removed the LIBVNCSERVER prefix from all the #ifdefs

 + left all the threaded code disabled (LIBVNCSERVER_HAVE_LIBPTHREAD
   is undefined)

 + disabled the rfbInitServer name mangling in rfb/rfb.h

 + disabled include rfbconfig.h and rfbint.h from rfbproto.h

 + removed the conditional defines of encoding types in rfbproto.h.
   They should always be defined.

 + removed LIBVNCSERVER_ALLOW24BPP - always enabled.

 + removed all the http server crackrock.

 + removed font.c, draw.c and selbox.c.

 + removed cargs.c.
