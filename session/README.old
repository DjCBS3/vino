Vino Session Management
=======================

  The Remote Desktop server provides a background service for the
desktop. How to implement activating such services isn't a very
clearly defined area in GNOME. There are two common approaches:

    + Make the service session managed and put it in the default
      session.

    + Make it possible to activate the service with bonobo-activation
      and make gnome-session control the lifecyle of the service.

  The second option is more attractive for Vino, because we would
really not prefer to have the service running if it is disabled. In
this directory you have both options:

    + vino-session is a small program which you can add to your
      session and it will control the lifecycle of the service.

      [ i.e. add something like the following to 
        $(datadir)/gnome/default.session:

          4,id=default4
          4,Priority=20
          4,RestartCommand=vino-session --sm-client-id default4

        and increase "num_clients" by one. ]

    + gsm-remote-desktop.diff is a patch for gnome-session to control
      the lifecycle directly from the session manager.

  The code for both is more or less the same. If Vino ever becomes
part of the desktop this will be resolved for good by choosing one of
the options above, coming up with a better way to manage the lifecyle
of generic services or by making it feasible to run vino-server while
it is disabled.
